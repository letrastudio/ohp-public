        This teahouse, a National Monument since 2011, emerges planted and anchored in the Boa Nova rocks, completing and adding value to the landscape that is highlighted by a chapel and a lighthouse that do not mimic or confront it. Getting near it and rising up is made through a staircase that goes along the several quadrants, between earth and sea. We access it in the centre that goes down vertically before getting into the two rooms. Over a base of reinforce concrete and a curtain of glass, the coverings that move and swing seem to levitate over the sea horizon. Different equipment like lamps, tables, and chairs designed by the author are integrated today in a restaurant of an awarded Portuguese chef. The mechanism that opens the windows surprises the visitors coming in. There is a framed poem by António Nobre – the Portuguese poet used to wander about the place.

        The vertical tower in reinforced concrete, 46 meters in height, is the second highest in Portugal, and stands over 3 horizontal volumes that include a museum and form a U shape that welcomes the visitors. The luminous fountain, with a reach of 52 km at present, moves with watch mechanisms and is fed by a petroleum generator since the beginning, in 1926. After 1950 it starts being powered by electric engines, supplied by the public electric grid since 1964. Directed by José Joaquim Peres, the lighthouse replaced a smaller lighthouse, called Boa Nova, built after the shipwrecks of steamboats, ships and yachts that occurred between Leixões and Esposende. The elevator built in the 1950s competes with the 255 steps that reveal the horizon. It is one of the two viewpoints with 360º panoramic view that are part of the itinerary.

        Initially marked by the existence of a lobster vivarium, this place maintains a dialogue between natural elements and artificial information. The several straight parallel walls in reinforced concrete, that are “cut” at the bar area by a plan that points to the crane or “titan”, contrast with the nature of rocks and the sand. So then a path appears, that is slow and that alternates between being either parallel to being perpendicular to the sea, descending, partially buried to free up the view of the horizon to whoever is circulating in the road. The high walls postpone the discovery of the sea, giving access to cloakrooms, showers and toilets, bar and also the water treatment station that belongs to the sea. The walls in reinforced concrete support the wooden and copper roof where the partitions are suspended. If we go down and peek, we can grasp the continuous pavement, free as the sea.

        The new cruise terminal, located at Molhe Sul of the Leixões Port, stands today as new local and national iconography, simultaneously capable of stimulating and cheering up the place. Designed to be seen from the horizon, it is a symbolic and metaphoric door into the modern city since 2014. The spiral serpentine is a symbol of Porto’s marine coast, materializing a continuous ascendant path between the pier and the roof, a viewpoint like an amphitheatre turned to the sea. The movement of a helical ramp that involves the central and vertical quadruple span dominates the interior – between the material and immaterial space, between real and virtual environment. The glass contrasts with the textured and luminous ceramics that suggest a vertiginous dive, simultaneously sensory and unreal.

        Celebrating 40 years, the silos emerge vertical and monumental in the northeast of the Leixões Port, occupying 25.000 square meters that include road, railway accesses and warehouses to receive, move and dispatch cereals. It comprises a storage silo, an expedition silo, an elevation tower, a horizontal warehouse, and also administrative services. The bucket water-wheel tower is 95 meters in height. The storage battery is 65 meters from the ground and is made of 13 x 3 circular silos with 60 meters of height and 8.20 meters of diameter. The 5 meter bottom span allows the contemplation and experience of a nave with a ceiling indented by the space left empty by cells and intercells, making us think of a cathedral, reinforced and exalted by dusty and filtered light that invades the space. One can also learn about a variety of Portuguese buckets, vases or feeders that seem to be all around the place.

        Visit accompanied by Architect João Paulo Rapagão
        
        The 4 houses that occupy the 3 volumes, closed off from the street but facing the gardens and public space, are marked by the contrast between the compartmentalizing of bedrooms and the fluidity of the sitting rooms. They reveal themselves as labs for the architecture that the author develops, with experiences and influences of vernacular Japanese way of construction, in stone walls and wood details; and the popular Portuguese way of building, in roofs, carpentry work and stairs. Le Corbusier contaminates the spans and plasters, A. Aalto the intimate spaces, W. Gropius the functionality, and finally, A. Gaudí the gates and the exuberant and extravagant chimney, covered with glass mosaics, a novelty in the 1950s, learned in the studio of F. Távora. We are visiting the home of Fernando Neto, Álvaro Siza’s first client that has lived in the house since 1957. He tells us that in response to criticism, “the architect didn’t pay any attention. He said time would tell”.

        The City Hall (1987) is the result of a public competition of ideas promoted in 1980. Its spatial organization and conception highlights the public space and the relationship between exterior and interior. The contrast between the naves with double and triple height, in relation to the atrium and the vertical accesses, and the galleries that take you to services – highlights a space that we want qualified with democratic participation, and that is reached in the municipal assembly and the noble hall, open, without limit, to a wider and better spatiality. Historically, the image and language symbolically adopt the marble and, linguistically, Aldo Rossi’s theories of rationalism and functionalism. Finishes and ceramic coatings give texture and work the light that invades the inside. Simultaneously monumental and amicable, it materializes the representation and proximity to the citizen wished a few years after the revolution of April 25th 1974.

        The Real Vinícola block, dedicated to the production and export of wine and olive oil, was created (1897-1901) when the company left the Douro riverside and settled in Matosinhos, near the new Leixões Port. The industrial complex starts at the rail line that connects to the port and is organized around the double central patio where spaces of storage, carpentry, cooperage, laboratories, administrative offices and a guardhouse were placed. The spatial structure persists, after the 1930s it was abandoned, and after the April 25th 1974 revolution it served as residence for families that were coming back from the ex-colonies. In its reconversion in 2017, it reopened as the headquarters of the Casa da Arquitectura, headquarters of the Matosinhos Jazz Orchestra, and other multifunctional and commercial spaces.

        The company, founded in 1920, occupies a building from 1923, extended in 1945, part of the urban plan by Licínio Guimarães for the Areal do Prado. Maintaining the traditional and artisanal production of tinned fish – sardines – coincides with the conservation of the building that joins together today’s industrial production technology with existing old equipment. The preparation of bay leafs and the production of artisanal tomato pulp guarantees the quality and durability of the products. The factory towers reveal the influence of English industrial models. The nobility and richness of the materials of the atrium is dominated by the spiral staircase that goes up to the office where the environment is still as it was long ago. The routines of the bell have also been maintained – it’s played to start the day under the gaze of our Lady of Fátima.

        With a building strategically placed at one of the entrances of Matosinhos, a centre for engineering and product development marks a change focused on new technologies, sustainability and new ways of being mobile. Conceived as an international centre for investigation and development for aeronautics, mobility, ocean and space, and the automobile, its architecture explores a rhetoric of the future and is organized in two buildings. In the main one, an elliptic façade decomposed by rotation, houses the common and investigation spaces designed in ellipses of different scales: auditorium, reception area, common zones, meeting rooms; that interconnect with leisure and work areas. The other volume, rectangular and of great dimensions, houses the hangar for aeronautics and metal mechanics testing, prepared for different scales, from the electric car to the wing of an airplane.

        A working industrial space where you can observe the intimate relationship between architecture, machinery and engineering. Inside the premises of a Senhora da Hora block, today urban and central, the mill made of an iron and wood structure was installed to receive machines (modernized in the 1960s), the gigantic silos of concrete of the 1980s to store cereals, the labs to test flours and the making of bread, cakes and cookies. As well as the most recent office block and the flour and final products warehouse, in which a caster system operates the compaction storage by gravity. The visit follows work hygiene and security rules, and it can be noisy.

        The metropolitan transport infrastructure is installed in Guifões, where the many carriages and machines that take millions of passengers every day in several metro lines that cross Matosinhos, Porto and Gaia reside. Here, 70 kilometres of public transport is supervised and, in the Central Command Post, inspections and maintenance of the vehicles are made, to optimize and secure the network. A vast architectural complex, far from the view of a common citizen, will be open to exclusive visits, which start on a specially assigned carriage that will leave from the Senhora da Hora station and head to the location of the visit.

        An old warehouse belonging to Lionesa (a company created in 1944), today houses another company dedicated to looking and comparing prices. A metallic structure that brings regulation and order, separated from the perimeter of the nave, makes this intervention autonomous, differentiating the old and the added, duplicating the useful surface with an elevated pavement destined to the workers of this company, in an open space with natural light. On an upper level a translucent box is destined to management. This concept is extended to the meeting room next to the reception area. The closed boxes in the ground floor are meant for toilets. A kitchen area serves a leisure space, commonly used. The infrastructures are visible and coherent in the validation of an industrial and current aesthetic, reversible and mutable. We go up the steps, and the calories burned are counted in the on-going exercise of up and down the stairs that dominate the atrium.

        The headquarters of the biggest national company of production and commerce of beer and water can be found strategically associated to road infrastructures – Via Norte – and railroads – Linha de Leixões –, contiguous to the company Lionesa and in the proximities of Leça do Balio Monastery. Giving continuity to the União Fabril Portuense Company, the unit has a dynamic implantation generated by administrative, industrial, repair shop related and social components. The naves for bottling and storage are updated, since the start in 1964, till the present day. The premises of functionality, quality, and growth capacity are clear in the way it is organized. We can add the premise of visibility, evident in the copper tanks integrated in the extensive façade, a great window to be looked at from the fast automobile. This is the media coverage and renovation of the values of the new architecture of the 1950s where industry was a glorifying and stimulating theme for the architect.

        Over the old walls of the building of a modest neighbourhood bakery a single home grows, made for a type of urban living: transparency in the floor below, privacy of the suites and terrace in the new floor, with its wood exterior. The bakers shop, turned to the street, became a space for a kitchen and for meals where utensils, books and music intertwine through a glass wall/shelf. The new patios allow the light to be brought in the house, making it flourish with the sunshine from the outside, inside a very narrow Foz Velha block. In the middle floor, where the oven used to be, is now the music studio prepared acoustically, where new and old hits are rehearsed by a well-known Portuguese band.

        The count Carlos Alberto Cabral, a well-read cosmopolitan industry man from Vale do Ave, inherits the farm and calls some great names for its conception – Charles Siclis, José Marques da Silva – and for the decoration of the house – Ruhlmann, Lalique, Brandt, Bruhns, Leleu, Perzel, Subes and Porteneuve – between 1925 and 1944. Modern, exceptional example of national art deco, this home is equipped with the most recent heating and ventilation electrical/technical infrastructures of the time. The house, the garden and park are a unit ordered by axes of composition and organization of the program in three floors: kitchen, pantry and service areas below ground but with ventilation and natural lighting; atriums, sitting and dinning rooms on the ground floor; and bedrooms on the top floor. A staircase overlooks the garden and park designed by Jacques Gréber. For this visit we will open the doors of the elevator, the safe, the kitchen and the technical infrastructures spaces of the house.

        Inaugurated in 1855, Porto’s second public cemetery is located in what was one the former Agramonte Farm, demolished and burned by D. Pedro IV during the war between constitutional liberals and absolutists. The organization and composition of the floor plan highlight the Chapel – initially signed by Gustavo Adolfo Gonçalves e Sousa, in 1866, and afterwards enlarged by José Marques da Silva, in 1906 – and the Municipal Tomb. An attentive visit reveals graves designed by Soares dos Reis and Teixeira Lopes, the last addresses of Manoel de Oliveira, Guilhermina Suggia, António Carneiro, Emílio Biel or Júlio Dinis, amongst so many others, and the tomb to the victims of the horrible Baquet Theatre fire. According to Pinho Leal, this cemetery succeeded the one for “irrationals”, shared once with the poor deceased at the hospital.

        Palace-like building created in the beginning of the 20th century that was home to the Institute of Deaf-Mutes - Araújo Porto, founded by José Rodrigues d’Araújo Porto. It became, through a donation, the propriety of the Santa Casa da Misericórdia do Porto [Portuguese charity], and it was inaugurated in 1904. Since the first steps of industrialization, this place was meant to offer autonomy and education to those otherwise excluded, so that they would have a productive and engaging professional life. The building was rehabilitated to foster the Shared Services and the Corporate Centre of Porto’s Santa Casa da Misericórdia, reopening to the public in 2016. It got the National Award of Urban Rehabilitation in the category “Best Intervention for Commercial Use & Services”, in 2017.

Henrique, created in 1884, was built for the instruction and education in the subject of drawing, and had in its first enrolment 555 students, 544 boys and only 11 girls. Teaching included preparatory studies for the Commercial and Industrial Institutes, feminine jobs like dressmaker, embroiderer, seamstress, florist, and also manly jobs like carpenter, locksmith, mechanic, goldsmith, manufacturer of precision instruments, plasterer, bookbinder, were some of the things being taught at the time. The main courses that served many companies in the north of Portugal were the Building and Construction course, the Building Technician specialization course, and others like Graphics, Electro-Mechanics, Construction or Textiles. The visit takes on the school complex, namely, the workshops, gymnasium and classrooms.

        This 19th century building, originally used as a home and afterwards as a social care facility till 1975, got an intervention that brings harmony to the existing materials – stone and wood – and today’s materials – plaster and polycarbonates. Associated with the Caminhos do Romântico [Romantic trails], the house occupies 3 meters by 17 deep. The house entails four floors that grow between the entrance, the bedroom, the sitting room, the kitchen and the study that goes on to the terrace, a unique setting. Each use is associated with different materials and textures, a way to identify and customise them. After dark, the illuminated polycarbonate alveolar reminds us of a diaphanous lantern lit over Porto’s Historical Centre skyline.

        This studio occupies one of the twinned lots undoubtedly art deco and that were implanted in this street in 1865, suggested by the Count of Resende. Occupied by a printing office and a Graphic Arts workshop, respectively at East and West, the latter is today an architecture studio reachable by an existing staircase. Old and current uses live together: the meeting room is in the old repair office and the co-working space occupies the nave where the old printers were. Here, the wall and ceiling structures reveal themselves operative at a spatial and at a construction level. The contemporary is visible in the green volume amongst the already described uses, destined for the pantry, bathroom and offices, this way concentrating here the infrastructures. The past becomes present in the shelves that recycle doors from demolitions or industrial remnants where one can read “Please Do Not Discuss Politics”.

        In the fortified city, the great big public or private buildings stand out with volumes, design and symbology that distinguishes and highlights them. However, it’s the small buildings and constructions that give texture, density and diversity to the streets and neighbourhoods of the centre. The Torrinha House, a modest construction, is a recent rehabilitation where you can see the potential of contemporary architecture when facing pre-existing conditions, new commodities, functions, aesthetic dimension, give value to small and modest spaces, bringing them to a current way of life, in a small lot, with garage and garden in the centre of Porto.

        The acquisition and addition of several lots in the old Quartéis Street allowed the construction of a palace, a farm and a factory for the Moraes e Castro family in the transition of the 18th to the 19th century. The narrative of this building reveals patios and neoclassic wings used as palace, royal palace and, from 1942 on, as a museum. It also holds a velodrome, amongst other memories and histories visible in the renovation made from 1992 on for the event Porto European Capital of Culture 2001. Because of the Tirador de Ouro e Prata factory, the visit comprises the reserves and the discovery of the uniform of D. Pedro IV, founder of the museum in 1833.

        The New Customs Service, built in 1859 over the old Miragaia Beach, occupies 36.800 square meters. Its composition and organization – a central body, two at East and two at West – is symmetrical, neoclassic. The structures are granite, iron and wood. The big areas, occupied before with customs warehouses, are now destined to be a museum. The large dimensions of the rooms – cellars, auditorium, customs room, noble hall and archives – are opposite to the smaller scale of the ready-mades associated to the cranes, wagons and rotating platforms still in the space. The building is civil architecture with commercial and industrial traces, representative, and capable of announcing the entrance of the city between the second half of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century. The riverside front is, because of that, more elaborate than the one facing the city.

        Above the dominant bore gauge of the historical centre comes up the gable of a suspicious vertical volume, which has been used for a long time for advertising. Since 1880, hidden from view there is a factory of lead for hunting guns with a tower of about 40 meters, the necessary height to allow the passage of liquid to solid lead. During the fall spheres are formed of different diameters that drop in the water tank, expertly placed at the same level as the river. Between the upper and lower floors, where the polishing is made and the treatment and bagging by calibre, there is housing - and the two uses are skilfully held together. Today, the tower seems to stubbornly validate itself and its usefulness by hiding the telecommunications antennas in the historical centre from view.

        This building has its origins in the 17th century and is a portion of the plot that holds four other buildings related to Travessa do Ferraz; the most important portion with the square located near the old Olival Wall of the Muralha Fernandina. Initially destined to be a home, this printing office of the middle of the 20th century is today a coworking space. Its reserved uses – reception and meeting room – coherently adopted the older rooms, segmented. The naves of the old printing office, wider, are now multipurpose and coworking spaces, with the exception of a lounge that opens up to the Historical Centre. The transformation reintegrates existing values, namely structures, spans, frames, equipment and furniture. Recently, paintings were revealed in the structure and substructure of the building, they were hidden in the plaster ceilings, which is uncommon in similar cases.

        The Ultramarina Insurance Company builds in the 19th century a commerce and housing building in an street opened over the Rio da Vila to connect the S. Bento square to S. João Street, justified by the commercial and industrial development of the second half of the 19th century. Today, renovated and adapted into a hotel in the historical centre, its architecture is contemporary by using the past as a raw material in an exiguous floor plan conditioned by its geometry. The change in use required a renovation incompatible with the old way of dividing and distributing. Besides the required sound and thermal update, the intervention maintained the composition of the eclectic façade and its interior structural elements and materials in wood, making accessibility better with an elevator and a central staircase that reminds us of Maurits Cornelis Escher.

        This printing office is born in 1905 at São Crispim Street, and it still exists today with its full name: Peninsular – Papelaria e Artes Gráficas. Founded at the end of the 19th century, in the following century it moves to Mouzinho da Silveira street, to a building with a housing and bourgeois structure, adapted at the time. “Não perca tempo a pensar... compre na Peninsular” [Don’t waist time thinking… just buy at Peninsular], shows with its first slogan the typical energy of family run printing industries. It is notoriously one of the few 100 year old institutions from Porto with these characteristics to survive as a family business till today, facing the market changes and the technologic evolution of the world of graphic arts.

        Inaugurated in 1905, the headquarters of the União Cristã Central da Mocidade Portuguesa [Christian union of the Portuguese youth organization under the regime of the Estado Novo], was used as a hotel afterwards, and then housed an association connected to the Young Men's Christian Association till 2004. The old classrooms, library, gym – the first in the city – and the protestant cult hall, highly designed and ornamented, denounce the presence of the Christian union in a building that is clearly Beaux-Arts. Today, the building is occupied by the creation and production of custom-made suits. To the simultaneous artisanal and industrial use, a cafeteria was added and rooms were adapted to the making, inspection, dispatch and showroom of suits. Contrary to the current trend, this building has adapted and has become industrial.

        Opened up by João de Almeida e Melo in the site of the former Campo de Santo Ovídio, the square is crowned by the neoclassic barracks built by D.Maria I, in 1790, to house the 2nd Regiment of the Porto Infantry. A block is designed with three floors in the main and central body, a portico and a balcony are added at the end of the 19th century, with two floors placed at east and west, closing at north with a floor in front of the Lapa church. It is believed that its main façade corresponds to the dimension necessary for infantry units in military parades. We can highlight, in the first floor the noble hall, preceded by the marbles of the landing of the Mindelo and the giving of D. Pedro IV’s heart to the city of Porto, and in the second floor the official residency ready to secretly host Charles and Diana in 1987. Since 2006, with the end of the North Military Region, it houses the Portuguese Army Staff Command.

        Paraíso Street, an artery that gives access to downtown Porto, is an area of the city that shows the vivacity of the reconstructions and rehabilitations of housing buildings. This house on Paraíso Street responds to the reconfiguration of the urban mesh, with a peculiar counterargument. If today the main façades of rehabilitated buildings are kept, legally they tend to be unchangeable or they have a complex process, as maybe this was the case with this one. So the inverse challenged is set: to take on the old façade and surprise with a new posterior façade, to be seen from inside the block. In the two-floor house, the new posterior façade is daring, with a green, black and white pattern, facing the garden and neighbours, with the same exuberance than before when façades stood out on the street.

        From Hat Factory to Arts Factory – in this building there used to be a textile industry that responded to the fashion of the 19th and 20th century and, since 2009, is the Sculptor José Rodrigues Foundation, a group of artist’s studios, exhibition rooms, art and graffiti galleries, and spaces connected to cultural and social functions. Founded in 1842, this was one of the three functioning hat factories, with 200 workers. In 1908, the title of Social Royal Factory was given to it and it survived as a weaving factory, producing plastic and other materials until 1986. The setting of this factory complex in the centre of the city is characteristic of the time, is made of the production hangars, the contiguous neighbourhood that housed the workers, the house of the owner, and a garden and a yard that produced fruits and vegetables. The visit is centred in the spaces belonging to the foundation, inside the industrial complex.

        Created in 1914 to liberate the work of the masons from Porto, when the São bento Station was being constructed, this co-op built many modern buildings with the most prestigious architects from Porto. The co-op built its headquarters in granite, over the quarry from where it extracted its raw material. There, they have offices, the old deactivated industrial complex and the professional school that pays homage its historical manager, José Moreira da Silva. The iconic yellow tower is covered by tiles that depict the mallet and chisel of the bricklayer. It has 15 floors that comprise a restaurant, a hotel, a radio station, homes, café and offices. Its decoration in granite is a catalogue of the technical skilfulness of mechanized masons.

        Robert Auzelle’s model of renovation for the city opened the way for this tower, the headquarters of the newspaper Jornal de Notícias, that joined the nearby towers from the north side of the Gonçalo Cristóvão Street (1962) and the D.Henrique Hotel (1965). An office tower built over a podium meant for the newspaper rotary press, is highlighted in the city’s skyline combining in a coherent manner the use with its form, showing diversified façades with protruding granite frames. It also exhibits Charters de Almeida’s urban art to the viaduct that is elevated from the ground. If, in the past, its construction forced the demolition of the Raul Dória Commercial School, in the future it will allow its renovation as a hotel unit with about 250 rooms and, on top, a glass volume with a restaurant with a view over the city.

        Located on top of the avenue, thought through by Carlos de Pezerat and designed by Barry Parker – initially planed to reach Estrada da Circunvalação – the City Hall is the result of a public competition. It is the contrast between the horizontal volume of the corridors, rooms and noble halls; in six floors, a basement, two patios and a 70-meter tower that peeks out and competes with the city’s other iconographies. Inaugurated in 1957, it’s one of the last buildings to frame the then Nações Aliadas Avenue. Inside, we can highlight the Holy Mother of Vandoma, the Noble Hall decorated by Gustavo Bastos, the D. Maria II Room and the Sessions Room covered by Guilherme Camarinha’s tapestries. The ramps that give access to it were before a full width staircase, commented and repudiated by all.

        At the start of the 20th century, with the industrialization and modernization of society, recreational non-profit associations rose. This club, created in 1904, is still today a living example. It began at Batalha Square, but in 1935 moved to the building near the city hall. Contrary to its name, of Irish political and revolutionary origin, the club is born of the festive desire of a cultural and artistic carnival activity inspired by Brazil and Venice. Today it houses activities of solidarity, philanthropy, dance, magic, games, music or parties, having received the title of Commander of the Military Order of Christ and the City’s Gold Medal.

        The Municipality of Porto gave the Academia Contemporânea do Espectáculo, this palace built by the count of Bolhão in 1844, as an expression of a political and economically vigorous bourgeoisie. Stage of royal visits, parties, duels, scandals, it is given to the creditor of the count that sells it to be the headquarters of Casa Biel. In 1916, Cadvilla Film moves in, a pioneer of advertisements in Portugal. The outside area receives in 1922, the Bolhão lithography. Today, it is a teaching and production facility of the Bolhão arts and theatre school. The building is neoclassic, richly ornamented with wood mosaics, plasters and paintings of some of the best and biggest artists. We can highlight the Noble (ball) and D. Maria II Halls, theatrical and ideal environments for its new uses. The extension has an auditorium, neutral, connected to the palace by a walkway that crosses the patio. In the façade, over the pediment; Mercury watches over the success of commerce, but also of the arts.

        Located at Passos Manuel Street, this building rose from the Sociedade Nova Euterpe, and on August 29th 1869 became of the union of associations and groups of small industrial, commercial and traveling clerks from Porto. In 1885, the union moves to the current building. Culture, education, instruction and playground are words inscribed on the staircase that guides us to the impressive noble hall. This is a private institution that has as aim to promote cultural and ludic activities, establishing a space that cements relationships between associates, like old British clubs. The club was a meeting point of public and political influence, refuge of Portuguese writer and politician Almeida Garrett and the place where the First Republic was proclaimed in Porto. Between dance and talking, the club is the faithful holder of artistic and literary works, with upmost historical importance for the city and the country.

        A physical and material symbol of the industrialization of the big cities in the beginning of the 20th century, it was here that those that were going downtown parked their cars in the 1940s. A project by architect Mário Abreu, inaugurated in 1939, it is right in front of Porto’s Coliseum. The building has four floors and its lines are art deco, and it distinguishes itself by the neon sign that depicts the roads that would connected the north to the south of the country back then. The ground floor is occupied by services that kept changing along the years, but we can highlight the barbershop that resisted to the several transformations of society. On top of the building, on the fourth floor, the bar, cultural association and residency space Maus Hábitos settled around the year 2000 – it is the apartment space with a privileged view over the city of Porto.

        Founded in 1868 by the politician and journalist from Porto Anselmo de Morais, its initial headquarters were at Bonjardim Street, and later they moved to the current address at Formosa Street. This four storey building, recuperated for housing with a project by the studio of Garcia-Albuquerque, mirrors, in the space today kept as a garage and parking lot, the place where once the printing office and machines were fully working during the golden days of this industrial nave. Once small palace and high school, this place is emblematic of the historical and cultural construction of the city of Porto. In 1983, it was acquired by the Encadernação Manuel Ferreira & Silva, fulfilling for a few more years its function and the importance of the graphic arts industry in the north of the country.

        To know the city of industry is to think about the spaces of science, innovation and knowledge. To look at life in an industrialized society makes us look at the new cities of the dead, their symbols and celebrations. To think about human longevity is also to consider its limits – in which places can we think about destinations? The semi-circular space of the Anatomical Theatre is a place with a relationship with death, when the body is given to science, for the good of knowledge and society. Composed by elements in marble stone, like the great big lavatory with original pedals, or the marble counter itself, it is completed by displays with samples from the pathologic anatomy collection.

        The i3S joins the IBMC, the INEB and the IPATIMUP, in a consortium lead by the University of Porto. Together they manage projects, share equipment, and supervise PhDs and Masters, in an institution with about 900 researchers integrated under research and innovation policies in tune with six schools of the University of Porto and three hospitals. Dedicated to science and technology, this infrastructure with 21.229 square meters is compact with long reinforced concrete urban façades that levitate and seem to release the public space. The universe of scientific and technologic research needs introversion and concentration, so they resorted to vertical and diagonal indoor patios, which create proximity relationships with the community that uses them. The collective spaces are identified by the blocks that give shape and texture light, by opposition to the aseptic surfaces of the labs that create a regulating and ordering unit that manages the intervention. The open tops and the elongated and closed surfaces are interrupted only to light up the atrium and indicate the entrance.

        In the old road to Guimarães, in the Regateiras Farm, it was inaugurated in March 1883, the monumental architecture building Alienados Hospital with funds that came from the inheritance of Joaquim Ferreira dos Santos, Ferreira Count. Inspired in the Pedro II Hospice in Rio de Janeiro, it is today a Hospital Centre run by Santa Casa da Misericórdia [Portuguese charity]. This health unit was granted the statute of great research, education and assistance centre in the field of Psychiatry in Portugal. It is an establishment seen as a daring hospital for its time; and it’s a vast building composed by several pavilions and study labs surrounded by gardens and support units – workshops, printing office, laundry and kitchen. We can highlight the panoptic pavilion, with a centered floor plan to hold restless and furious patients.

        Today one of the Faculties of the University of Porto, this used to be the Fine Art School where architecture, painting, sculpture, and later Design and other artistic subjects were taught. A small palace that held the Aula Magna, the library, the museum and the administrative offices, the faculty is organized along a beautiful garden, with centennial trees, sculptures and a lake, where many of the teaching pavilions are located, all from different periods, languages and functions and all signed by renowned architects from Porto.      
The architecture pavilion maintains its designation from when it held the classrooms and auditorium for the teaching of architecture, a course today autonomous and installed somewhere else, at FAUP, in Campo Alegre. Besides this iconic space, we can visit the exhibition, techniques and drawing pavilions, or the south pavilion, the most recent, that has a new façade at Alegria Square.

        A product of industrialization and a model for the almadino urban planning that sets plots with a measurement of 25 hand palms in the street front and lengths that can reach 100 meters, the islands housed the working force that arrived in the city in the second half of the 19th century. The homes that are part of it, with 9 to 16 square meters, grow in depth with one or more rows, with one storey and with a passage of 1,5 to 2 meters. You can access it, still today, by going through the bourgeois house that faces the street. Patios and shared bathrooms create a singular neighbourhood feel. Oscar’s island, known before as Américo das Balanças, has today 10 houses that grew in height or by taking over the patio. D. Quitéria’s island reminds us of hard times, when coats were also blankets. It also reminds us that with 25 cents you could either take a shower at Balneário do Campo 24 de Agosto with a clean towel and hot water, or you could have a cake, a Bola de Berlim or a Jesuíta.

        This bourgeois building of the end of the 19th century built to be the family residence of D. Maria Coimbra, holds this museum today. It has been many different things, during the Spanish Civil War it was the home of Spanish nuns, later it was bought by the Portuguese state that transformed it in the PIDE headquarters (Portuguese political police) in Porto, a place for interrogations, imprisonment and torture, between the 1940s and the Carnation Revolution, in 1974. Right next to Porto’s first public cemetery, Prado do Repouso, after PIDE was occupied in 1977, the building became the military museum that opened in March 1980. The visit includes the access to the historical building and the exhibition pavilion, in the garden.

        An inscription stands out in the decorated granite façade: Blip Web Engineers. In Camilo Avenue, the architecture of the old Porto Nascente garage maintains its grandiosity – it’s a building with a romantic façade and a powerful inner concrete structure where once automobiles, icons of modernity and economical status would circulate. Today, it’s a tech company where, instead of mechanics, code and information is produced, and betting apps are programed. Blip follows an organic and informal spatial concept and organization, where open spaces connect with private meeting rooms, a canteen, a meditation and massage room, videogame rooms, lounges and a community vegetable garden, guarantying a connection between work and life.

        The dentil-like roof in the red blind façade turned to Camilo Avenue, tells us this group of four warehouses that exist within this block have been reconverted. Reconverted to house the headquarters of the engineering company A400, the building with its metallic structures and the wood asses of the roof has an open space defined by a labyrinth of screens that hold the several nuclei of specialties of engineering, like the preparation of the work and the project: electricity, structures, 3D models, meeting rooms, and others. Within the same block, some renovated warehouses hold garages, others are still abandoned and await the moment of reconstruction.

        Bought in 1932 by the Municipality of Porto, the Nova Sintra farm gets the Reservoir in 1928 and the Central in 1929, matching up the woods and the romantic garden of the “Englishmen’s house” with the biggest infrastructure of water storage of the city, destined to duplicate the capacity of the Jovim/Santo Isidro conduct. The municipalisation of the water supply to each house in 1875 created a secret layer under the streets that we cross everyday, with conducts, valves, and others, this way no longer needing fountains and springs. Today with the project Porto Gravítico implemented by the Águas do Porto, E. M., has no use for most of the reservoirs, supplying and going along the city according to its topography. Today the storage capacity of the six reservoirs of the city is of 125.450 cubic meters, which corresponds to a reserve for more than two days.

        In the oriental part of Porto, parish of Campanhã, an entrance and access to the industrialized city, old site for big farms and bourgeois houses, we can find the micro-geography of neighbourhoods of blue-collar workers. At Miraflor Street, between accesses to island houses and to warehouses that support the Railroad Station, in a series of similar warehouses, the spaces MIRA and MIRA FORUM appear. These warehouses are about 200 square meters and their wood asses, granite walls and wide doors, reconverted in 2013, are today dedicated to photography, exhibitions, talks and artistic residencies. In the back, under the trees, you can enjoy the shade of the lounge area.

        In the oriental extreme of Porto, a group of buildings tops up a roundabout that gives access to the riverside as well as the exit towards Gondomar, signalling the transformation that is wished for Freixo and Campanhã. This building inaugurated in 2009, responds to the place, is eclectic and takes on different characters, between the rehabilitation of old housing buildings that frame three extremely contemporary industrial volumes. Uniting them, a new terrace that takes advantage of the view over the Douro river and an outside green area. Projected by an architecture and engineering company with offices in the building itself, this work has an industrial technical language with a spatiality and organization divided in several lofts, with a public exhibition and event gallery at the entrance.

        The Freixo Palace, decorated ostentatiously, with four towers in the corners of a rectangular plan centered in the garden, is proof of the Baroque style of D. João V, potentiated by the gold that came from Brazil. Initially, around 1748, it was the home of D. Jerónimo de Távora de Noronha, but in 1850 it became the property of industrial businessmen. In 1890, the new company Moagens Harmonia acquires the palace making it its headquarters. Between 1952 and 1969 the company transfers to the north building, that today is undergoing transformations. In 1984, it is sold to the state that gives it to the Municipality of Porto to make it the headquarters of the Porto Metropolitan Area and the Science and Industry Museum. Between 1998 and 2003, the farm and palace are recovered, and then afterwards in 2009, it is given to the Pestana Group to install a Pousada de Portugal there.

        This elegant tower stands out in the skyline with its 177 meters in height. It is an icon of the metropolitan landscape, visible at great distance, it comes out of the Monte da Virgem trees like a vertical concrete needle that distributes the telecommunications air signal. The tower points out Gaia and states the importance of antennas and civil communication in the most recent phase of industrial revolution, the dissemination of information and communication. In the proximity of its base we can find the Monte da Virgem sanctuary and the RTP studios [Portuguese television], both dedicated to communication – religion vs. audiovisual production. This visit to the tower includes going up to the panoramic floor with a view of 360º, unique in the metropolitan area.

        On June 24th 1991, S. João’s day in Porto, the railroad bridge in the Northern Train Line over the Douro River was inaugurated. This bridge would eventually replace the centenary bridge D. Maria II. A project of engineer Edgar Cardoso, with 1140 meters of length, this bridge sets itself not in a arch but in a continuous multiple portico of vertical pillars. Made of one unique continuous piece of reinforced concrete, it has a road with two lanes that connect the North to the South of the country and where passengers, goods and products pass between cities and ports. It is the propriety of the National Rail and was made by the FERDOURO-ACE consortium.

        Inaugurated in 1925, the building is composed by two symmetrical horizontal volumes united by a central and vertical body, accentuated by the watchtower, where one goes in by a staircase under a porch and terrace signalled by the city’s coat of arms in granite. The solemnity and importance of the entrance is adjusted with a domestic scale dear to the author, who signed institutional works – Sanitarium and Heliântia Clinic  – but mainly housing. The dominant eclecticism can be seen in the ostentatious and decorative granite, highlighted by the towed and white surfaces. The two volumes articulate with the corner through the baldachins that hold the sovereign letters given to the city between 1255 and 1518. In the centre of the south and east bodies, one can find covered and uncovered balconies in wrought iron where the values of administration and local managing are remembered and evoked: Work, Honour, Nobility and Civility, and on the east side, Truth, Justice, Virtues and Honesty.

        The Serra do Pilar Monastery is today the Portuguese Army’s Barracks for the Regiment Artillery Nº5. Its vocation and defensive occupation is clear due to its location and today also due to its dimension and historical representation. In 1809, the building received the troops of Duke of Wellington that from the south margin, already without the Barcas bridge that disappeared during the conflict, prepares defeat and the withdrawal of the French troops, a victory celebrated in the Heroes of the Peninsular War Monument. Later, in the middle of the Portuguese Civil War, during the Siege of Porto of 1832-1833, this building beared witness to the victory of the liberals, and the escape of the defeated that set fire to the Port Wine warehouses. 17.374 wine barrels and 533 of schnapps were lost. D. Maria II recognized their importance in 1835 and decreed its classification as 1st Class War Square.

        Located over rocky mountains and initiated in 1537, this national monument is in the list for UNESCO’s World Heritage, competing with the Episcopal Palace and Porto’s Sé [cathedral] for the prominence in the landscape connected by the bridge D. Luís I. Designed and consecutively expanded and transformed, the church and the monastery consecrated to Santo Agostinho present an organization and composition of renaissance and mannerist inspiration, adapting skilfully the Grijó and Moreira da Maia models. Its originality results of the meeting of two circular plans – cloister and dome church – with the same diameter associated with the concepts of perfection and infinity connected with God. In the scarp over the Douro River, there are some constructions by Porto Moreira and Casino da Ponte, previously acquired by Barros & Almeida.

        In the epicentre of the Port Wine Cellars, structures emerge that renovate the architectural fabric that once was the headquarters of small industries and wine production warehouses, bringing new services and ways to host tourism. Between narrow and dark streets, the gate and patio of 7G Roaster Apartments opens up, a new set built from scratch in concrete and wood within the perimeter of the old granite warehouse. Conceived as a place to rest, it consists of seven touristic apartments that sit over a wide coffee house with handmade roasting, following the central concept of expert coffee with specific roasting, “just toasted”, that can be savoured in the common and public floor of the building.

        Amongst Port Wine cellars, one can find the Sacramento space, that is part of the once Corpus Christi Convent (São Domingos das Donas Monastery, built between 1345-1354), a complex acquired in 2003, today belonging to the municipality. Its reconversion and modernization makes the industrial space fit for a new use, more sensitive and close to the movement of the body. Functioning here is the Ginasiano School, that teaches different types of dance; and Armazém 22, an auditorium dedicated to artistic residencies, a contemporary dance and performance program, headquarters of the Kale Dance Company and presentation space for the work of national and international artists.

        After the Peninsular War, a Scottish soldier decided to stay in Portugal and create a brand of Port wine, symbolically represented by a cock and a crown – Cockburn’s, founded in 1815. Since 2006, another family company with roots in the Douro region, Symington, is the owner that proudly maintains the cellars in the traditional style, celebrating the place where this divine wine is matured in the barrels and centennial oak tree mashing tubs. The wine rests in the long, almost never-ending, longitudinal corridors, under long coverings made of wood and tile. Considered to be the biggest port wine cellar, with the largest collection of oak tree barrels, it distinguishes itself by the handmade cooperage where daily Symington’s barrels and mashing tubs are repaired.

        Stimulated by the proximity of the railroad and the Port wine, the old warehouse that today is an architecture studio is part of a group that before was occupied by warehouses and factories of boxes, cork stoppers, bottles and demijohns.   
Its access is made by the top of the nave visually dominated by the structure of the wood covering, the two plans articulate two accesses at different levels of the two streets. The initial installation in the year 2000 rationally occupied the upper floor with an open space that explores visually the structure of the roof, opening a mezzanine that separates the individual workstations from the central circulation imposed by the entrance of the warehouse. In 2016, the extension made created an axial staircase that connects the studio to the kitchen, bathrooms and main office located on the ground floor. In the materials you can see clearly the two dates of intervention with their continuity and unity.

        The three houses in a row made for three brothers, occupy diverse terraces of the hill occupied by the ruins, the housing and the warehouse connected with the street that accesses the higher level. With descriptions dated from the 15th century and diverse occupations – farm, monastery, warehouse, factory, cooperage, charcoal plant and housing – from the 17th century, the current houses occupy the central body, articulating the surrounding geometries and altimetries. Each house develops on three floors, the lower connecting with the public space, in the space of the cooperage, destined to be the sitting room and kitchen; the middle articulates with the common circulation and distribution that connects the ruin to the warehouse destined to be a garage; and the upper floor occupied with the roof span bedrooms that observe the landscape. A narrative unfolds between the mine and the water tank, revealing itself capable of unifying the outside spaces.

        In 1914, at the Regadas farm, in the Candal area, a small electric porcelain industrial unit emerged and became a national reference when it comes to industrialization and electricity: the Candal Electro Ceramics Company, producer of low tension electric equipment, high voltage insulators and, also, daily use domestic tableware. In 2014, in a new life cycle, it changed to another line of work – space rental to small companies and creative industries, currently Candal Park, a centre for companies and businesses. The visit focuses on the building of the old company canteen, today shaped into two office floors, where we can point out the original concrete roof and the pliability of the new central space, dedicated to meetings and informal conversations.

        In the most popular neighbourhoods of the city, amongst modest houses and other constructions, some buildings designed and built with great detail stand out. An example of that is the RV House. Made for a young family with children, the environment inside, the natural lighting, the paths and organic spatial modulation correspond to a specific way of life. In its small scale, the house opens up and closes views, creating a universe that values the inner world. The chosen material, wood, that got it the National Award of Architecture in Wood for the excellence of the project, defines the project’s options, alongside the concrete in plain sight. The RV House demonstrates the potential of contemporary architecture in creating context, qualifying not only its interior but also the neighbourhood itself. In this house, you walk barefoot, so visitors are invited to follow the example of the hosts.
